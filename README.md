# Hydrate
This is an Android App made for the Udacity Grow with Google Android Basics Scholarship course. It's inspired by the Court Counter lesson.

This app was inspired by #WorldHealthDay. It calculates the approximate amount of water you should drink in ounces based on your weight and then provides three buttons that correspond to popular beverage sizes which allows the user to track how much water they've consumed.
