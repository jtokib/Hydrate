# Hydrate
This is an Android App made for the Udacity Grow with Google Android Basics Scholarship course. It's inspired by the Court Counter lesson.

This app calculates the approximate amount of water you should drink in ounces based on your weight. 
It then provides three buttons that correspond to popular beverage sizes and allows the user to track how much water they've consumed.
